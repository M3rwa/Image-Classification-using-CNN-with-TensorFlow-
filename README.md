# Image Classification using CNN with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Image Classification using CNN.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow.

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning predefined labels or categories to images. CNNs are a popular choice for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and extract meaningful features from images.

This project aims to provide an example of how to build an image classification model using CNNs in TensorFlow. The notebook walks through the entire process, including data loading, preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes a dataset of images for training and evaluation. The dataset may be specific to the problem being addressed in the notebook, such as recognizing handwritten digits, identifying objects in images, etc. The dataset used in this particular project is not specified in the repository, but it should be provided or referenced within the notebook itself.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and execute the code, the following dependencies are required:
- TensorFlow: The deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for running and modifying the notebook.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow jupyter
